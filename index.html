                <p>
                    At b-12 we are building AI agents to facilitate the use of automated labs.<br>
                    Backed by <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">YC (S25)</a>, we are on a mission to revolutionize how researchers interact with lab automation.
                </p>

                <h3>Why is this a problem?</h3>
                <p>
                    Automated labs are the future of chemistry and lab experimentation.
                    They are far more reliable, reproducible, and ultimately more efficient than traditional labs.
                    However, <b>they come with a steep learning curve</b>.
                </p>

                <h3>Our Solution: AI-Powered Simplicity</h3>
                <p>
                    Our AI agents act as an intelligent interface, translating complex scientific protocols into seamless, automated lab operations. We empower researchers to design and execute experiments with unprecedented ease, abstracting away the typical complexities of lab automation.
                </p>

                <h3>Why Using b-12?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Drastically Reduced Learning Curve:</strong> <em>Spend less time learning new systems and more time on your research.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Increased Efficiency & Throughput:</strong> <em>Automate repetitive tasks and run more experiments with the same resources.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Flexibility:</strong> <em>Flexibly create and execute new workflows, optimizing your robot's uptime.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on Science, Not Software:</strong> <em>Our intuitive AI lets you concentrate on your scientific questions, not on programming complex machinery.</em></li>
                </ul>
